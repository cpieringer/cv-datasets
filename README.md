| MVImageNet  | MVImgNet contains 6.5 million frames from 219,188 videos crossing objects from 238 classes. Authors provide an OneDrive link to download the full data. You also require fill a online form to ask for credentials. | Yu, Xianggang; et al  | MVImgNet: A Large-scale Dataset of Multi-view Images (CVPR2023) [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06042)]| https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/MVImgNet| 
| EPFL Multi-view Multi-class Detection dataset  | The dataset consists of 23 minutes and 57 seconds of synchronized frames taken at 25fps from 6 different calibrated DV cameras. Also, has a ground truth set that contains 242 annotated multi-view non-consecutive frames. | Gemma Roig; Xavier Boix; Horesh Ben Shitrit; Pascal Fua; et al. | Conditional Random Fields for multi-camera object detection [[IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6126289])]  | https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-multiclass/|
| EPFL Multi-View Car Dataset | The dataset on this page contains 20 sequences of cars as they rotate by 360 degrees. There is one image approximately every 3-4 degrees. | M. Ã–zuysal; V. Lepetit; P. Fua | Pose estimation for category specific multiview object localization [[IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5206633)] | https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-pose-index-php/ |
| EPFL Multi-camera pedestrians video | This dataset consists of multi-camera sequences used to develop and test a people detection and tracking framework. All sequences feature several synchronized video streams, filming the same area from different angles. The cameras were positioned about 2 meters above the ground. | F. Fleuret; J. Berclaz; R.
